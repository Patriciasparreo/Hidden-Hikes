                <p>
                    The Lodato Park Loop Trail is a rare find. Unknown even to most locals, this hike reminds us of a miniature version of the extremely popular and well (some might say over) traveled trails at Muir Woods National Monument. We have often visited Lodato and met no one else on the trail, adding to the illusion that you are the first to enter this primeval forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lodato's primary trail is well-defined and marked with sturdy, permanent signage. The trail twists and turns frequently, and includes several steep inclines. Diversions are abundant, and can add distance as well as difficulty to your hiking experience. Trash cans with dog waste disposal bags make this a popular place for those with four-legged companioins. If you marvel at the majesty and seek the solace of a redwood forest, then be sure to visit Lodato soon!
