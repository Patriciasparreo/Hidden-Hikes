                <h3>Why hidden...?</h3>
                <p>
                    You won't find crowds of people at any of our hidden hikes. Depending on the day, you and your party might be alone on the trails, giving the illusion that you are truly the first to discover this particular gem. Witnessing silence and solitude while in such beautiful surroundings is an experience that we feel you simply can't get anywhere else. Yet, as peaceful as they are, these hikes also evoke a thrilling and most satisfying sense of adventure in that you feel like the only hiker to have ever traveled the trail.

                    The hikes are lesser-known and are often easy to miss even when you are actively looking for them. They feature short trips similar to those found in state and county parks, but do not require admission charges or parking fees. With that said, keep in mind that they also tend to lack some of the basic amenities. For instance, most of them do not have restroom facilities. This makes them most suitable for short treks (lasting only a half-day or less), or as awesome, quick diversions when you are enroute to some other destination. Sound intriguing...? Then go exploring today!
